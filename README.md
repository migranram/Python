# Python---Varios
Several mini-projects for PYTHON. I have taken reference from may sources in the internet. I do not claim this codes to be 100% mine. This is just a library where I'd like to put some useful (or interesting) pieces of software.

This is used to wrap several **.png** files into one **.gif** file in an easy way

## + Music_Player
Small and simple console Music Player

Some codes plotting different fractals.
